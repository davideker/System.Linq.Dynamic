# System.Linq.Dynamic

I originally came across this source code on Scott Guthrie's Blog while searching for a mechanism to execute dynamic linq statements against entity framework. However, this code did not support executing a full lambda expression represented by a string against my entity objects so I extended it to support this feature. I thought my efforts might benefit someone else so I decided to share it. The original code is licensed under Ms-PL and in accordance with this license the derived codebase I have created is licensed similarly.
